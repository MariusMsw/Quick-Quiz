# Quick-Quiz
A Quiz application without the assistance of libraries or frameworks. This application will be able to load questions from a 3rd party API, track and display high scores etc. I used Local Storage, create animations, modern ES6 JavaScript features, and more.
Here are some of the topic I covered:

   Save high scores in Local Storage

   Create a progress bar

   Create a spinning loader icon

   Dynamically generate HTML in JavaScript

   Fetch trivia questions from Open Trivia DB API

   JavaScript - Array Functions (splice, map, sort), Local Storage, Fetch API

   ES6 JavaScript Features - Arrow Functions, the Spread Operator, Const and Let, Template Literals

   CSS - Flexbox, Animtations, and REM units
